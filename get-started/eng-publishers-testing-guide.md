# \[ENG] Publishers : Testing Guide

This guide is designed to help publishers easily test OursBlanc's **specific ad formats** using their ad server, whether it's **Google Ad Manager, Equativ, or Xandr**.

Although OursBlanc formats are **custom and not compatible with standard ad formats**, they can be implemented **quickly and effortlessly** on your site without requiring any technical intervention from your teams. In just a few minutes, you can launch tests, and once the test campaigns are running, our teams will **fully handle the integration and adaptation** of our formats to your site.

## **Pre-requisites Before Testing**

Before providing you with the test scripts, it's important to note that **most of our formats require a "friendly frame" environment**. Depending on your ad server, this might require a **modification when setting up the ad creative**.

ðŸ”¹ **Google Ad Manager**: Make sure to **uncheck the "Safe Frame" option** to allow our formats to function properly.

Once this setup is complete, our formats can be displayed in **any size**, from the smallest (1x1 pixel) to the largest (e.g., a 1800x1000-pixel skin). Since our formats **extend beyond their placement area**, you can **freely define the best dimensions** for your tagging strategy.

## **Best Practices for Optimal Display**

To ensure smooth delivery and avoid issues, keep the following in mind:

âœ… **Avoid calling the same format multiple times on the same page**, as this may cause conflictsâ€”especially when using Google Ad Managerâ€™s "Preview" mode.

âœ… **Our formats do not support refresh mechanisms**, which can disrupt their proper display.

âœ… **Lazy loading techniques** can also negatively impact their performance.

Aside from these considerations, the **integration process remains the same for all our formats**, including **SmartCover, SmartScroll, SmartRead, SmartPulse, SmartMax, and SmartSkin**.

ðŸš€ **By following these guidelines, you can quickly test and maximize the potential of our formats on your site.**
