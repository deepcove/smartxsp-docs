# StackAdapt

Welcome to our guide on effectively utilizing our ad formats within the StackAdapt DSP. In this documentation, we will walk you through the process of activating private deals to ensure high visibility rates—around 70%—of your creatives. Additionally, we'll cover how to create and implement the visual components of your campaigns, pulling scripts from the SmartXSP platform and ensuring everything is validated and ready to go.

## **Activating Private Deals on StackAdapt**

The first step in adding a deal on StackAdapt is to ensure that you have access to the "BYOD" (Build Your Own Deal) feature. If your agency doesn't yet have this functionality enabled, you'll need to request its activation from your StackAdapt representative.

Once you have access, log into StackAdapt and navigate to the "Inventory" menu. Under this menu, you'll find a sub-menu called "My Inventory." This is where you can access the list of inventories available to you. If the BYOD feature is activated, you'll see a dedicated BYOD tab. Clicking on this tab will open a new section where you can create your own deals.

In the top right corner of the BYOD page, you'll find a button that allows you to create a new deal. You have the option to choose between a Programmatic Guaranteed (PG) deal or a Private Marketplace (PMP) deal. For our purposes, we will select the Private Marketplace option. This will open a form that you'll need to fill out in order to create your deals.

Currently, we recommend creating two separate deals: one for mobile devices and one for desktop devices. We'll include screenshots to illustrate exactly how to fill out the form for each type of deal.&#x20;

Additionally, we provide a summary table highlighting the key information you need to record, particularly the Deal ID that is generated in the system.
