# Macro in Creative URL

It's now really easy to add macro in your creative URL, you just have to put ${MACRO\_NAME} in your URL.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you add a new macro in one of your creative URL you should generate your script for adserver again (new macro will be added in the script).
{% endhint %}
