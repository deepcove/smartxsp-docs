# Skin mode

With SmartCover, you can enable the skin function, which allows you to display a site skin when the technical characteristics of the screen or display area are met. Creating a site skin is not simple; you must adhere to several constraints during visual creation. To assist you in this task, we have created a display template in PSD (Photoshop) format.
