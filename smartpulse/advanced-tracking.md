# Advanced Tracking
The advanced tracking of SmartPulse allows you to analyze in greater detail how internet users are utilizing the format.
## Main KPI
Before delving into the specific indicators of SmartPulse, it's necessary to discuss the impression and viewable impression indicators. The impression indicator corresponds to all the calls made to display the campaign, which also includes all the impressions purchased across the programmatic network to disseminate the said campaign. Viewable impressions, on the other hand, correspond to the number of times the Hiro has been displayed, meaning it's not just the display of the pulse that leads to the counting of a viewable impression.
