# How to create your first campaign

## Product section

The first step in creating a campaign involves selecting a product or an advertising format that you want to broadcast. A campaign in SmartXSP can only pertain to a single type of advertisement. You will not be able to change this parameter once the campaign is created. However, the type of visual contained in your campaign can be modified; at this stage, you do not need to know whether you want a video, an image, or a photo gallery.

## Buy section

The buy tab will allow you to define the main characteristics of your campaign: its name, its start date and end date, as well as broadcast parameters such as the broadcast volume, the budget, and the purchase cost on programmatic marketplaces.

### Client / Account

The client selection field will allow you to associate your new campaign with one of your clients or with your own account in the case of a self-promotion campaign. The client selection will enable you to retrieve the commercial terms of the latter but also to grant them read-only access to the statistics of their campaign. Providing access to the campaign is an optional feature, which you can enable on a client-by-client basis.
